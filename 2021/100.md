In this lecture series we will examine how to properly layout the page
let's use flex homepage for an example.
the best practice is for every page to have a header section at the very top where the logo and menu reside.
At the very bottom is the footer section where the site map and copyright reside.
 in between is the main section and where the main conten resides.
In html code, we can easily model this, inside the body, we can write header as the first child.
main as the second child. 
The footer as the third child.
when we clearly section the content of our body in this way
screen reader will be able to  easily understand our page and therefore properly commuicate to any user with disability.
Also this make it easilier for search engine slike google to accurately index our page to help us to attach the right users to our site.
