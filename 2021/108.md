Another popular relative unit is the percentage. 
It is very useful because its lenght is relative to its parent.
Let's demonstrate this with our header section as the parent. 
And a nav section as it's child. 
Let's give the parent a width of 75 viewport width.
And a height of 75 viewport height and a background of red
As for its child let's make its width and height 50 percent of its parent. 
finally let's make it's background orange.
When it appear we expect its dimension to be exactly half of its parent.
Perfect!
what do you think will happen if we adjust the viewport width. 
the child is still 50 percent of its parent. 
what if we adjust the viewport height. 
Still 50 percent.
