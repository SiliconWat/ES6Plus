to select the head element using javaScript 
we start with document because that is where the entired HTML dom tree resides.
the dom tree always begins with the root element
which we can get using dot documentElement
since the head element it its first child we can get it using dot first child
finally we log it into the console.
To get the body element we can simply follow the same logic,
first we get the root element document.documentElement 
Since the body element is its last child 
We can get it using dot last child
Finally, we can log it to the console. Let's check all of our answers. 
Awesome!
