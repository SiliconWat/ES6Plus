Now that you have experienced your first coding exercise. I would like to mention so good habits for coding exercise. 
Try your best to solve the problem yourself before watching my solution. if you are stuck, go back and rewatch my lecture for that problem set. 
The solution will be found in those lecture. If you are still stuck you may watch my solution. 
On the other hand, if the problem set is easy for you and the solution is obvious, watch my solutions anyways. 
My appoarch is may contain insight you may not realized. 
You think your appoarch is better, please consider sharing on the discussion board with your fellow students.
Since you are learning on your own without any supervision, it is easy to cheat or skip these coding exercise. 
If you can commit to doing them properly, you will definitely grow and learn alot throughtout this course.
