The main element and the footer element to add section to our body we also learned how to use the nav 
element and the section element to further divide and organize our section into subsections. When we are ready to add real content 
we learn how to use heading one thru heading six elements. 
The figure element, the paragraph element, the anchor element, and the button element to describe our content. 
When you take the time to use the correct HTMLelements for their intended purpose. Our html code becomes semantic.
