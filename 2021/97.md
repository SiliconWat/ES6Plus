Why would we use one method over the other. Just like CSS each methods, has the same pros and cons. 
In practice external js is best because we can contain all the JavaScript code in one file. 
While we can give to the engineers in our teams.
our engineers can simply confuse on and edit this one JavaScript file.
whicle our designer and copywriters can focus on and edit this css file. and html file repectively. 
Again, we want separation of concerns because this minimized team members from editing the same file at the same time. 
Finally, while css code is executed based on specificity
Remember that Js is executed on order of appearance.
