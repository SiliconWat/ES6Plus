Let's put to practice what you have learned. 
Your first coding exercise. 
It will be super simple.
So you can focus on familiar yourself with this new testing format on udemy.
The instruction will always appear in the top half while the bottom half, you will do your coding
Most of the time, there will always be three files for you to work on.
Each corresponding gets three web language, HTML, CSS, JS.
Again, the reason is because learning all three language at the same time will deepen your understanding of each one. 
For each file, there will be specific instruction for you to follow. 
In the HTML file, the code you write, for example, when we render will appear in this window just like codepen.
In the CSS file, the code you write will also get render thru this ui window just like codepen.
When your finished, click check solution. 
The top half will be the console window just like the codepen.
If there is a mistake in your code some hint will it will appear in this console window.
For now, don't worry too much if you don't understand what the console is trying to tell you.
In time all will be explained.
