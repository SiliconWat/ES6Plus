there are three ways to code css code in our HTML document
The first method is called external
Which uses the link tag inside the head. 
link tags do not have content so a closing tag is not necessary.
Formerly they are known as empty element 
because they do not have any children.
In other words, we can think of empty element like parents who cannot have children. Instead link tags have attribute that we can specify.
Attribute always have the form name of the attribute equal quote the value of the attribute.
For example to import external css file
We specify a relationship attribute in a hypertext refer
The second method to include css code is called internal
which uses the style tag inside the head
Unlike the link tag, the styletag have content and therefor must include a closing tag
the content is css code
in other words we can think of nonempty element like parents who can have children
finally the thrid method to include css code is called
inline which uses the style attribute
on the tag that we want to style
the value of the attribute is css docoration statement
