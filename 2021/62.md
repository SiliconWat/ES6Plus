Let's review what we have learn so far by referencing MDN. You can find the link to this article in the resource of this lecture. 
Our data structure can be a simple as plain text. 
Like this in our HTML. And it will still appear in the UI for our users. 
But to go beyond plain text our data needs more strutures. We can do this by appling HTML tags, like this.
Basically, the syntax of every HTML tag has this HTML parts. 
The plain text is know as the content.
The content is enclosed by an opening and an closing tag. 
Both tags are surrounded by angle brackets. 
The only difference is that the closing tag has an additional backlash.
The type of tag is determined by its name.
Clever by design, the more popular the tage, the shorter its name to save you time from typing so much.
Altogether, these parts makes up every HTML element
