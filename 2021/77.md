in an HTML tree struture is great because css code can understand it.
For example we have learned that to select the body tag, we can simply write, body curley braces.
To make the background green, we can write background, green.
there is another way we can use to select the body tag
since the body tag is the last child of HTML
we can use this special selector
colon slash child curley braces
to prove that this works let's change the background to orange
background orange
there it is.
lets say we want to select the head tag
again we can do this by simply writting head curley braces
or you guess it, colon first child curley braces.
what is the difference between the head tag and the body tag.
the body tag is where we show our content. the head tag is where we describe the entired document such as its title, author, date etc
because the head tag has no content to show 
css code here does not make sense it will not appear for example background, blue, see no changes.
