Stag two, we begin to know that we don't know as we go thru this course you will find yourself here most of the time.
Don't give up because all junior experience this. 
keep in mind that you are not expected to know everything just enough so you can where you can find the right answer on google.


with enough practice your will find yourself in stage three Where you know that you know
this is the goal of this course. 
when you are in midlevel you search less and less. So you become a faster and more confident coder.


with enough experience you will find yourself in the fourth and final stage where you don't know that you know. 
You have such greate intuition from all your user coding that you are able to learn new things faster and faster. 
This is stuff from senior and rockstar engineers.

Another differenece between a mid-level and a senior
