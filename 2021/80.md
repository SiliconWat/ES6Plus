Let's summarized what we have learned.
HTML document organized into tree structure because they are easiler to read and faster to 
In a HTML tree structure always start with the root HTML tag inside of which there are only two possible children the head tag
followed by the body tag
The head element is where we plae info about the document such as the title author etc
which is also known as the metadata 
The body element is where we place the visible content of the such as the header paragraph etc
Again, the HTML tag is the root element.
It's content is just one head element follow by one body elelment
The head element contain the meta data
While the body contains the actual content
Please commit this very important tree structure to memory
