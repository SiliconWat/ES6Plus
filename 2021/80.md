Let's summarized what we have learned.
HTML document are organized into tree structure because they are easiler to read and faster to search through
In a HTML tree structure always start with the root HTML tag
inside of which there are only two possible children
the head tag followed by the body tag
The head element is where we place information about the document such as the title, author, etc
which is also known as the meta-data 
The body element is where we place the visible content of the such as the header, paragraph, etc
Again, the HTML tag is the root element.
It's content is just one head element followed by one body elelment
The head element contain the meta data.
While the body contains the actual content
Please commit this very important tree structure to memory
