In this problem set, we will explore three different ways to include CSS in our HTML document.
the first method is called external.
When we write our css code in this window in codepen.We are really writing our CSS code into a separate file. 
To demonstrate this , let's create another codepen file
Now let's move our css code to this new file.
select all, then cut.
Notice the orange background is gone.
then in our external file. 
We paste. To import this CSS external file, first we copy its link. 
then we go to our setting in our previous codepen.
under CSS  scroll down to at external style sheet or pen.
then past in the link. 
press save and closed. 
Now notice the orange background is back. What happened? what did codepen do under the hood to make this possible
the answer is by using a special tag called the link tag. 
Basicall to import any exteranl file.
All we have to do is to create a link tag inside the head tag. 
A link tag will never have any content so a closing link tag is not necessary. 
For readablilty we can add a backslash like this.
Again, this is optional and is not required.
To import our external CSS file we must give our link tag two attribute like this. 
REL is equal to quote style sheet
to indicate its relationship to its document to style sheet
and href and past in our link. 
href stands for "hypertext reference"
