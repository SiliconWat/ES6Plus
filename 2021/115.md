To make the navigation element a child of the header element we can simply add a nav tag  
In the css file, to make the header element exactly contain the header element we can simply give the width and height a value of fit-content.
The padding is just zero, the margin is just zero, for the border we can write solide, green and ten pixels in any order. For the nav element, the width is fifty viewport width the height is 50 viewport height. And the background lightblue to make it cover the content area only we can us background-clicp and give it a value of content box. 
The padding is 10 pixels on all side. The shortcut is padding ten pixel on the top ten pixel on the right, ten pixel on the bottom, ten pixel on the left.
Or just 10 pixel. The long way will be padding-top padding -right padding-bottom padding left ten pixel. The  border-sytle is double on all four side. The border-color is blue on all sides. And the border width is five pixels on all sides. Of course for each border property we can use the really long version of top right bottom and left. Finally, the margin is 20pixel on all sides.
Therefore, the long hand will be top twenty pixel, the margin-right twenty pixel, margin bottom twenty  pixel and margin left twenty pixel. Letâ€™s check our answer. Awesome.
