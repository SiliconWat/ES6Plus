Again, the hmtl tree always begin with HTML. 
Inside of which is head, follow by body. 
To import an external js file. 
we use a script tag inside the head.
Remember, event though there is no content 
a closing tag is required.
then we give it a source attribute
equal to a link to our js file.
To include internal js, 
we also use the script tag inside the head. 
Its content is JavaScript code.
To log  to the console. the number 3 
we can just write, console dot log three.
Finally, to include inline js we can add eventlisteners as attribute on any tag that we want.
For example on the body tag, 
we can listen for the load event by adding the onload eventhandler. 
Then we can set it equal to our inline javascript inside quote 
which is console dot log 7.
