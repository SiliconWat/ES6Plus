Relative units on the other hand do not always have the same length because they depend on something else.
For example. vw is a relative unit that depends on the viewport width.
Here in the codepen, the viewport is the ui window. 
And the viewport width is just the width of this window. 
Let's demonstrate with our header section.  
Let's make the width 75 percent of the viewport width.
And let's make the height 25 percent of the viewport width.
To make it visible, let's make the background red.
Now check out what happens when I change the viewport width.
See that the width and height of our header section rows shrinks to maintain the same proportion relative to the viewport width. 
This is why the vw is a relative unit.
Likewise, vh is also relative unit because it depends on the viewport height. 
Let's demonstrate this with our main section. 
Let's make the width 75 percent of the viewport height.
And let's make the height 25 percent of the viewport height.  
Finally, let's make the background green. 
Again check out what happens when I change the viewport height. 
See that! 
Like before the width and height of our main section grow and shrink to maintain the same relative to the viewport height. 
Like vw vh is a relative unit because one vh does not alway have the same length. 
It depends on the length of the viewport height.
