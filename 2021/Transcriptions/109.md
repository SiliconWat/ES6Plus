In the last lesson, we learn how to add demension to any selection tag
in fact we can add a width and a height to any HTML elements.
the reason this is possible is because in css everything has a box around it. 
Let us have complete control over the design of these boxes around our HTML elements.
And also specific the pattern border and margin.
Let's demonstrate this with our header element. 
As usual we can specific a width and a height.
The area defines by these dimension is offically known as the content. 
To see it let's make the background red.
Around this content, you can specify the border. 
There are a few options, for now let's just make it solid. 
In between the content and the border we can also specify a padding.
Let's make it 20 pixels.
By default the red background cover both the content area and the padding. 
to see this padding we can use a special background property called backgroud-clip.
And a value of content box. 
This tells the css to apply the red background only to the content area. 
Does this white area in between the border and the content 20 pixels padding.
Finally we can also specify the margin which is an area that extend out from the border of all four sides.
Let's make it 3o pixels.
