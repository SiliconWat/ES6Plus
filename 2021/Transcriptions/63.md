Let's review our CSS code using MDN as well, for now its okay if you don't understand everything that is written on MDN. 
Again, we are using MDN, because its best practice of senior engineer. 
So we want to begin familiarize ourself with MDN as early as possible.
We apply HTMl tags to our text to give it structure. 
That way in our css code we can select our tags using css rule set. like this.
basically, the syntex begin with the selector, for example, the name of our tag follow by the declaration block enclosed inside the curly braces.
the declaration begins the name of the property follow by the value. 
Separated by a colon. we can have as many declaration as we want. 
we just need to separate them by semicolon.
