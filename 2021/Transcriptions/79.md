For example, we know that the HTML tree begins with the root, HTML root tag
With JavaScript we can get it with the command document dot document element
To verify this we can console.log it, like this
It is a little messy as you can see because it is giving us the entire code pen HTML 
so lets us just ask for the tag like this
dot tag name. There it is.
we know, now know that document dot document element give us the root html tag
How would we get the head tag since the head tag is it's first child
we just add dot first child
to verify let's console.log it again
Again, its a little messy, because it's giving us codepen entired head tag 
so let's ask for the tag name only like before
tagname, there it is.
how about the body tag, can you guess how to get it. you got it
just add dot last child
document dot document element instead
This will give us codepen entire body tag so let's also add dot tag name like before
To verify this works, let's console it once more, there it is
To review inside document is the entired virtue HTML tree
to access it's children and its childrens' children and so on and so fort, we use a period or dot
This is refer to as the dot notation in JavaScript
