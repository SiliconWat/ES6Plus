Why is a tree structure better?
To answer this question, let's rewrite our tag in a linear fashion.
HTML, and body
Let's say we want to select the body tag. 
CSS and Javascript will needs to search thru each one by one until they find the body tag
In computer science we will say this method, "it takes linear time" 
If these tags are written as a tree structure, we can just look for a tag that is the last child of the HTML tag.
This mean we can skip searching the head tag entirly
In computer science we will say this method takes logrithmic time, which is much faster than linear time.
In other words by organized into tree struture we can avoid searching every single one to find the one we want.
