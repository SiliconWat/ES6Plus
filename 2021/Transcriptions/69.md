The solution for index.js
To select the p element using JavaScript the code is simply document.querySelector(), then inside the paranthesis we write quote p.
Again for now just commit this to memory later in the course you will understand what each part means. if you are curious document is know as an object.
We know this because of the dot that follows it.
Queryselector is a method of that object. we know this because of the paranthesis that follows it.
The p in quote is known as a string. 
Again, all this part will be explain in detail later in the course
Finally, you are now ready to check ur solution.
Congrats, on completing your first assignment.
