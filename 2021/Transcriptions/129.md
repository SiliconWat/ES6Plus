Using the rgb system to change the color of the pixel on a computer screen can simply vary the amount of the three primary colors alike. 
On a color wheel they are located at 0 degree for red
120 degree for green and
240 degree for blue
For coders and engineers this color system is simple and intuitive
Designer and painters prefers another system that uses another set of primary color
For them, Colors are produced by yellow, cyan and magenta.
On the color wheel they are the complementary colors of light located at
 60 degree for yellow
180 degree for cyan  and
360 degree for magenta
Using this system to create different shades of the same hue 
Painter can simply varies the amount of white paint can be added.
This amount of white paint is refer to as the lightness factor
Computers, printers, also use this system of colors however instead of using white to create different shades, Printers use black instead. 
The amount of black ink be added is referred to as the saturation factor.
Letâ€™s do some examples, 
To tell css that we are using the hue saturation and lightness system for color we write HSL
Then to get perfect yellow, for example,
 we write 60 degree for  the yellow hue on the color wheel
