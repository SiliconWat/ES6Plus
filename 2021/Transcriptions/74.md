problem one, log to the console the numbe twelve, to do that we use the command console.log()
Then inside the paranthesis we type 12.
Problem two. log to the console, the phrase, "hello world" again we use the command console.log(), inside the paranthesis we type in the quote hello world
Problem three, log to the console the p element. this is more challenging because we have to combine what we learned from the previous two lecture set.
First we use the command console.log() then inside the paranthesis we use another command document.querySelector() quote p. 
Now we are ready to check our solution.
Yaay, everything checks out.
