In this lesson we learned to get the exact width and height.
To get the width we use 
To get the height we use window.innerheight
We also learned to determine the four dimension of every element
The css width and height determines the dimension content
If we include the padding of both sides we would get the client width and the client height
If we also include the border of both sides, we would get the offset width and the offset height
When the child element is larger than its parent the child element overflows.
And is visible by default on the parent element. 
If we want we can choose to hide the overflow content. 
Of course we can make the parent element scrollable instead.
Using overflow x and overflow-y we can even control which is scrollable
To determine the dimension of the overflow content we can use js on the parent element to get the scroll width and scroll height.
