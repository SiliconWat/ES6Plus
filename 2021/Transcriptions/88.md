The third and finally method to include css in our code is called inline.
on the tag we want to include css code we can simply add a attribute called style equal quote are css decoration statement
background sky blue
for example
our css body selector is not necessary here because it's already imply its present inside the body tag
notice that there are now three different locations where are css rule set are identical, yet in this case priority is given to our inline CSS code.
Why is that? The answer is called css specificity. 
Basically state that priority is given to css property that is more specific
you may have guess it by now that inline css is more specific then internal css.
Which is more specific than external css.
In other word, inline css is the most specific and have the highest priority
while external is the least specific and have the lowest priority.
