In the last lecture we learn how to adjust  each side of our margin. 
if we can remember this order top right bottom and left we can use the short hand. 
margin: 40 px 30px 20 px 10 px. 
this is the top margin, the right margin, the bottom margin, the left margin. 
Like wise we can use for our padding as well. 
Padding 10 pixel, 20 pixels, 30 pixels and 40 pixels.
this is the top padding, the right padding the bottom padding and the left padding. 
of course we can also use the short hand for our border as well. 
Border-style: solid dashed double dotted. 
Border color orange yellow green violet
border width 10 pix 15px 20 px 25 pixel
If the left value is missing. 
It will take on the value of the right. 
If the bottom is also missing It will take on the value of the top. 
And if the left value is also missing. All side will have the same value as the top. 
This also applies to the padding. 
And the border style. 
the border color and the border width. 
border also has one more shortand if all sdie had the same style and color and width 
which is the case here we write as border solid orange 10 pixels. 
In any border if there is no width the default width iis 3 pixel. 
if there is no color the default color is black. The style is required.
