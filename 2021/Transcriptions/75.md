So far we have seen how tags can give plain texts more structure and how useful this is for selection and manipulation with css and JavaScript. 
In this problem set, we explore how HTML can allow any kind and as many tags as it want.
To make selecting anyone of them,  fast and easy, the creators of HTMl came up with a elegant way to organize htem. 
the brillant idea is to allow tags inside of tags. 
When we do this, we produced a data structure called tree structure.
Like a real tree, a tree structure in HTML begins from a root tag which is appropriate HTML.
Then, inside this root tag we have two and only two special tags, the head tag and the body tag.
Written like this is quite difficult to tell but the head and body tag are inside the body tag.
so the best practice developed among coders invention is to indent them like this.
Right away we can clearly and easily tell that the head tag and the body tags are inside the HTML tag just like a family tree 
we can refers the head and body tags as the children of the HTML tag. 
And the HTML tag as the parent of the head tag and body tag.
We can even be more specific and refer to the head tag as the first child of the HTML tag and body tag as the last child of the HTML tag.
