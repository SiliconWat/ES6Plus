We now know that every element has a box around it. 
In this example, the header has a content area which is 50 vw by 50vh.
This green area here. It’s padding is 10 pixels and this white area here its border is also 10 pixels. 
This purple area here. 
It’s margin is zero. We also know that the content dimension is known as the width and the height. 
If we include the padding the dimension is known as the defined width and the clientheight and if we also include the border, 
the dimension is known as offsetwidth and the offsetheight.
To better understand these different dimensions let’s calculate their exact sizes in pixels. The width is 50vw or 50 percent of the viewport width.
To get the viewport width we can use javascript and write window.inner width. To see it let’s log it to the console. 
The viewport width is 610 pixels therefore our width is half of that.
Likewise the height is 50vh or 50percent of the viewport height. 
To get the viewport height we can write console dot log window dot inner height. 
The viewport height is 365 pixels therefore our height is half of that which is 183 pixels. 
Remember a pixel is the smallest dot on the computer screen so it's not possible to have half a pixel.
