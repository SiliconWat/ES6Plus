In this lesson, we also learned four different way to position any elements. 
By default the position is static. Which means that it is positioned according to its placement on html. 
If we want we can choose to make this position relative. 
Which then allow us to decide how far from the top and how far from the left of its default position. 
We can also choose to make it position sticky. Such that when we scroll, its position remains constant. 
Finally, we can also choose to take its position out of the HTML tree entirely and make it relative to the viewport instead by using absolute.
To get its exact distance from the top viewport. 
We can use offset top on the element. To get its distance from the left of the viewport we can use offsetleft on the element. 
Lastly, we can also determine how much has been scrolled. 
To determine how far from the top. We can use scroll top on the parent element. 
Likewise to determine how far from the left, we can use scroll left on the parent element.
