let's now look at each bg properties one by one
always cover the entired viewport
as such some bg property does not work on element
demo on the main lement only
first let's make it full screen 
100vw a height of 100vh and a background color of green. 
so we can see it. 
it is  showing scroll bars  because  it a little big larger than viewport
the reason because it has a default margin of  8 px  
let's remove this  margin 
now the main element is exactly the viewport
let's add a background image
if we want to blend this bacgkround image with background color we can use background blend mode
the default is normal
but we can make it multiply
or screen overlay, darken, ligten, color  color burn hard light
sof light difference, exclusion, hue, saturation, color and lumnisoity
