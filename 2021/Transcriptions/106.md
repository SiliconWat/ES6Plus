In the last lesson, we learned how to use semantic tags to organize our content. 
In this lesson, we will learn how to add dimension to those tags using css code and make them appear in this UI window.
For example, let's give the header section a width and a height. 
To do this first we need to learn about length and css. 
Lengths are units of measurements and there are two types. 
Absolute and Relative. 
Let's begin with Absolute units. 
An example of an absolute measurement is centimeters. 
For our header, let's make the width 10 centimeters. 
And the height is 5 centimeter. 
To make it visible in the UI window let's make the background red. 
Centimeter is an absolute unit because everywhere in the world a centimeter always has the same agreed upon length.
Another example of another absolute is an inch. 
To make our main section the same size as our header section the width will be 3.94 inches.
And the height will be 1.97 inches. 
Let's make this background green. 
Inch is also an absolute unit because anywhere in America an inch always has the same agree value. 
In the computer world, an example of an absolute unit is a pixel. 
Which is the smallest dot on the computer screen. 
To make our footer the same size of our header and main sections the width will be 370 pixels. 
And the height will be 189 pixels. 
Let's make this background blue.
