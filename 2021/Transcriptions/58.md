Since codepen is where we will spend most of our time. Let's go over it again. But this time in more details. Like the name suggested, this first window is where we write our HTML code. This second window is where we write our css code. and this third window is where we write our JavaScript code. These three codes get rendered by the browser into this window to see and interact with. Finally, this console window, is a special window for developer to easily interact with all the code. In other words, this window is for the UI window for the user and this window is for developer.
