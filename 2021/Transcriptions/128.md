To make RGB shorter so we can type less it is possible to count base 16 instead of base 10 including zero. 
Each of three primary colors has 256 possibilities. 
When we only count from 0 to 9 we get base 10 or the decimal cyst.
Using this system we need at least three digits. 
For each primary color. 
Therefore in total at least 9 digits. 
To represent any color, 
If we instead count from 0 to 9. 
Then a  thru f then we get base 16 or hexadecimal system
Using this system we only need 2 digits to account 256 possibilities.
This means we only need 6 digits total to represent any color.
Letâ€™s do some examples.
To get a perfect red, you write, ff for red which is 255 in the decimal system
Then 00 for green and 00 for blue
To let css know that we are using the hexadecimal system by prefix it with a pound symbol
To get a perfect green we write #00 for red ff for green and 00 for blue.
To get pure black we write #00 for everything
To get pure white we write #ff for everything.
We can also add transparency to make a color fully transparent add 00
To make it 50 percent transparency 80
To make it no transparency make it ff
Finally there is even a nice shorthand you can use
If both digits are identical for each value you can just drop one of them.
