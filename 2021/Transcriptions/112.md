In css, there are two types of units, Absolute and Relative. 
Absolute units are not relative to and always have the same length.
Example of absoulte units are centimeters, inches, pixels.
Relative units are relatives to something and therefore do not always have the same lenght.
Example of relative units are viewport's width and viewport's height.
Where one unit is equal to one percent of the viewport width and height respectively.
Another very useful relative unit is the percentage where one unit is equal to one percent. of
the parent dimension.
