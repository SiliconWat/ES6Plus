to review css let's us control the 
background-color
backgorund imag
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-orgin-
background-clip
backgroud-position
background-size
background-blend-mode

if we want to write a little less css also give us a shorthand called background. 
using this shorthand we can simply write green for the color usrl
for the image no repeat for the repeat fix for the attachment border-box for the orgin border box, for the clip 100px by 50pixel for the pistion slash 
auto 100px for the size blend mode is not supported 
orgin needs to appear before clip and position needs to appear before size separated by a slash other than this the order of other property does not matter.
