Now let's look at the background origin property which is similar to the backgorund-clip than we alrfeady seen.
to see its effect. 
border solid 30px rgb
100 percent for red
0 percent for green
0 percent for blue
50 for transparency. 
let's also make the padding 20 pixels
notice that by adding the padding and border the main elmeent is larger than the viewport.
if we want we ccan make it fit the viewport by making the box sizing property
by default, it is set to content box which means the height and the width are just the height of the widht of the content areas
ife we set it to border-box the height and width will also include the padidng and border 
as you can see now that the scroll bar disappear and is now exactly the viewport
we have learned that with background-clip we can control how much the backround color covers
to make it content area we can use content-box
to make it covers the padding we cna use the padding box.
to make it cover all the way to the border we  can use border box
which is the default
similarly, we can control how the background image is position is using orgin. 
if we wanted to staart at the content area we can use content box.
if we want it to start at the padding we can us padding box
which is the defaullt finally if we want it to start a tthe border area we can use border box
