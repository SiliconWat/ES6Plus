to achieve this, every programing concept in each section will be taugh in three parts.
Part one, I will start by diagramming the concepts to help you developed a good mental model and a great intuition.
I will teach the concept using the data structure and show you some examples of the algorithm 
so you can use on that data structure. 
I will do this in a very methodical and scientific matter so you can clearly see the cause and effect.
Whenever possible i will reference Mozilla or MDN for short to ensured our coverage of the material
is complete and comphensive. And to hlep you really appreciate the current way of coding. 
I will always try to contrast it with an older and longer way of coding of the same thing.
