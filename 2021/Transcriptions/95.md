Like css the third and final method to include JavaScript code in our document is also called inline
on the tag we want to include JavaScript code, we can add attributes called event listeners for example on the body tag
we can use onload equal quote console.log seven
what this mean that the event to listen for is when the body finishes loading
onload means that after this load event happens execute this inline JavaScript code.
there it is in the console.
appearing last because its waiting for the body to finish loading
