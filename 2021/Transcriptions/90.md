In all three methods have identical css rule set. 
Priority will be given to rule set that is specific for example, 
inline CSS is more specific than internal CSS. 
Internal CSS is more specific than external CSS. 
This is called CSS specificity.
Why would we use one method over another.
The answer is that each method has pros and cons.
External CSS is great because we can contain all the CSS in one file. 
Which we can give to the designers in our team. 
Our designers can simply focus on and edit this one css file. 
While, our copywriters can focus on and edit this HTML file and nothing else. 
The drawback is that because its a separate file its slower for the browser to go fetch the CSS file.
Inline CSS is great because. We can style each tag individually in our HTML document. 
However, the drawback is our css code commingos with our HTML codes. 
Which can be confusing for both our designers and copywriter. Internal css, is great because its similar to external css in that all the css code is located in one place.
Yet it still exist in the same HTML file. 
Therefore, its faster than external css.
However, similar to inline CSS. Internal CSS is in the same file as HTML code, therefore, designer and our copywriter will have to edit the same file when we make changes. This can cause confusion and bugs.
For the best practice, therefore is external css because it creates separation of concerns. Which minimized teams from editing the same file at the same time.
