These four stages can be visualized as a learning curve. 
To summarized in stage one where we don't know that we don't know. 
Ignorance is indeed blissful. 
And when we begin to know that we don't know in stage two. 
It can be a tough uphill battle. 
And sadly many people quite at this stage.
And when things are difficult keep in mind that there is a plato exist in stage three.
And when we keep at it for long enough the intution we developed will make learning effortless in stage four.
