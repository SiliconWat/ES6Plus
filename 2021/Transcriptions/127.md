There are a few different way to specifiy the color we want. so far
we have use familiar color such as green and light green.
what if we want a more nauian between green and black gree. how would we do that.
we can use a color system called RGB.
Which stands for red green and blue. 
and nature these are three primary color of life from which we can produce any other colors. T
To get only a particular color varies amount of red green blue. 
in that a pixel computer screen 
3 color and depending on how much each one is light up each pixel can produce any color. 
In the RGB color system each value can range from 0 all the way to 255. 
For example, if we want a perfect red, we would make red 255 green 0 and blue 0. 
if want a perfect green we would make reed 0, green 255, and blue 0
similarly if we want a perfuect blue we would make red o, green 0, blue 255.
what is light green in RGB it is 144 238 and 144. 
what happens if we set 0 to everything.
we get pure black. 
what happens if we set everything instead we get pure white.
with rgb it is also possible to control transparency by default one resenting the node 
what happens if we make the transparency 15 percent as you can see, the parent background color lightsgreen scr thru a little. 
what happens if we make the parent complete. 
the parent background color see thru completely
