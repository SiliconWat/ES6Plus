Now let's look at color in greater details in css if we want we can specify a color property.
Then, whenever we want to add clor we can refer to it current color.
Howver we can only use current color in the current tag. 
Or any currecnt tage childrent
and use current color of the parent main.
It doesn't work instead its showing current color of black. 
What do you think will happen if you define a current color 
who gets the current color inthe body work
what do you think will happen if we remove the color in main. 
Since there is no color property in the current property css will look in the parent tag.
therefore the current color of main is also yellow. 
know that if css couldn't find in the parent
it will keep looking up the hmtl tree until it finds one
element without finding one it will use the default color black.
