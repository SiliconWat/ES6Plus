Hopefully, by now you should know that all html documents must begin with HTML as the roots.
Followed by head and body as its only two children.
The metadata resides in the head while all of our content resides in the body.
To make our body more organized and structured to help search engines and screen readers understand our content.
We use semantic tags wherever possible.
A best practice is to divide the body into three high levels called header main and footer.
Inside the header is where we usually find the menu containing links for example we can group these links inside a navigation subsection.
While the links can be created using anchor elements. 
Likewise, inside the footer is where we usually find the site map also containing links
For example, we can group these links inside subsection nav as well.
Again, the links can be created by using the anchor elements.
Inside main, the problems asked for three subsection 
Inside the first subsection, the problem wants a heading one element and an image element.
Inside the second subsection, the problem wants a heading two element and a paragraph element. 
Finally, inside the third subsection, the problem wants a heading three element and a button element. 
Let's check our answer. Awesome.
