Now letâ€™s suppose that our header has a nav element as a child. 
What if its width is 400pixel and its height is 300 pixels and its background is lightskyblue. 
As we can see, the child element is larger than its parent. When this happens we say the child element overflows. 
We can control how the child element overflows by using the overflow property on the parent. By default its value is visible. 
If we like we can make it hidden. And of course we can also make it scrollable up and down, right and left. 
If we want to we can make it scrollable in one direction if we only want to make it up and down along the y axis. 
Set overflow-y to scroll and overflow-x to hidden. 
If we only want right and left which is along the x-axis to overflow-x to scroll and overflow-y to hidden. 
We can also determine the dimension to overflow. 
With the overflow width we can write console dot log document dot Queryselector header dot scroll width. 
It is 410 pixels because the nav is 400 pixels plus ten pixel padding on the left. 
To get the overflow height we can write  console dot long document queryselector header  dot scroll height. 
It is 320 pixel because the nav is 300 plus the 10 pixel padding on the top and 10 pixel padding on the bottom
