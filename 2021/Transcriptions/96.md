Like CSS there are three ways to include JavaScript code in HTML document. 
The first method is called external which uses the script tag inside the head.
the second method is called internal which also uses the script tag inside the head. 
to import internal Javascript we can simply use the src attribute on our script tag to include internal Javascript.
We can simply write js code as the content as our script tag
Remeber in both cases a closing script tag is required.
Finally, the third method to include Javascript code is called internal on any tag we want we can create an event listener as an attribute. 
Formerly, they are known as global event handlers.
And there are many. 
The one we demonstrated is the onload event handler, which we used to listen for the load event before excuting our inline javascript code.
