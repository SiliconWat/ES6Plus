If the width is 305 pixels. 
What is the client width? 
It is 305 plus the padding on the right and the padding on the left. 
So 305 plus 10 plus 10 or 325 pixels. 
We can check this by first selecting the header document dot query selector header. 
Then add dot client width. To see it, letâ€™s log it to the console. Console dot log there it is. 
Likewise if the height is 183 pixels what is the client height.  
It is 183 plus padding on the top and the padding on the bottom. 
So 183 plus 10 plus 10 or 203 pixels. Similarly to check this we can write console.log document dot queryselector header dot client height. 
And there it is.
