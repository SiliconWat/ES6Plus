To make it even more search engine friendly and screen reader friendly. 
it is recommended that we also futher organized our sections to subsections. 
For example, inside the header section, we can group the meun inside a nav tag. 
We can also use this navigation tag to group the site map in the footer section. 
Inside the main section, we can clearly see mutiple subsection. 
Therefore we can simply use a generic section tag for each one.
In html code we can also easily model this. Insdie header, we can add a nav tag for the menu. 
Inside the footer, we can also add a nav tag for the site map. 
Inside main, we can add as many section as necessary. 
Again when we organized our contnet into sections and subsections using descriptive tag names we make it easy for search engines 
and screen readers to understand our page. 
Futhermore team members will appreciate it too because our HTML code is more organized and more easilier to read.
