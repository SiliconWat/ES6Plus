Again, CSS renders every HTML element as a rectangular box with these four areas. 
In this rectangular box is known as the box model. Let's explore the padding the border, 
the margin in more details.
First, let'\ make the margin area more clear. 
to do this We can make the parent of our header, body exactly the size of its children. by using the width of the fix-content, 
a height of fit-content; a padding of zero and a border of solid. 
Since main and footer have no dimensions, this second with area is the 30 pixesl margin of our header. 
Right now all four side of our margin are 30 pixels. 
If we want, we can make each side a different size. 
For example, 
margin top 40 pixel, 
margin right 30 pixels. 
margin bottom 30 pixel and 
margin left 10 pixels. 
likewise all four side of the padding is 20 pixel. 
we can also make each side a different size. 
Padding top 10 pixel , 
padding right 20 pixels,
padding bottom 30 pixels, 
padding left 40 pixel. 
As for our border we have three options. 
We can adjust the obrder style. 
Dash border color blue border width 15 pixels. 
like margin and padding we can also adjust each side of the border.
