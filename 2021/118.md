If the clientwidth is 325 pixels, what is the offsetwidth. 
It is 325 plus the border on the right and the border on the left. 
So 325 plus 10 plus 10. Or 345 pixels. 
To check this we can write, console dot log document dot queryselector header dot offsetwidth there it is.
Likewise if the clientheight is 203 pixels. What is the offsetheight it is 203 plus the border on the top and the border on the bottom. 
So 203 plus ten plus ten or 223 pixels. 
Similarly to check this we can write console dot log document dot queryselector header dot offsetheight. 
And there it is.
