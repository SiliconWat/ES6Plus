Remember, in HTML document, is really only a file with plain static text.
To make the document to update, the browswer convert the HTML into a special object in JavaScript called the DOM tree
thru a process called parsing. 
In fact, css code is also just a file of plain static text
so the broswer also parses it and attaches it to the DOM tree
Finally, the broswer paints the DOM tree onto the UI display.
By converting this static HTML tree into a virtue DOM tree in memory document becomes more dynamic therefore easily changable.
without this, for example smooth animation will be extreemly difficult or impossible to achieve.
In JavaScript, the dom reside inside a special object called the document
To access it's children and any descendant we use the dot notation.
