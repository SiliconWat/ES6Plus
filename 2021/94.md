We have just learn that the first method to include JavaScript code in our document is to imported using a script tage inside the head
we also learn that codepen uses this method for the JavaScript code we write in this js window like css the second methods to include JavaScript code in our document is also called 
internal.
to do this is quite simple 
we just use the same script tag inside the head
Its content is JavaScript code for example, 
let's log three to the console.
Notice that thre eis log first and hello world is log second 
why is that? 
the answer is because JavaScript is executed in the order it appears
since this internal JavaScript is first and this external is second that's the order of execution.
