Finally, let's look at JavaScript because we have arrange our HTML into a nice tree structure.
JavaScript can follow this structure to build an exact model in the computer memory.
this way it is much easiler and much faster to make changes to the HTML tree.
In other words, In HTML document by itself its just a static text file
by converting it into a virtual model, in the memory, the HTMl tree becomes more dynamic
as a matter of facts this model is easily the most important object of all on frontend thus given a special name, 
the Document Model Object, or the DOM for short.
In javascript is represented by a command, 
document inside of which is the entired HTML virtual tree
