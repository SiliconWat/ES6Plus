When all three methods have identical css rule sets priority will be given to the rule set that is more specific.
for example inline css is more specific than internal css.
and internal css is more specific than external css.
This is called css specificity.
Why would we use one method over another.
the answer is that each method has pros and cons
external CSS is great because we can contain all the CSS in one file
which we can give to the designers in our team.
our designers can simply focus on and edit this one css file 
while our copywriters can focus on and edit on the HTML file and nothing else
the fall back is that because its a separate file its slower for the browser to go fetch the css file.
Inline css is great because we can style each tag individually in our HTML document 
However, the draw back is that our css code co with our
HTML code which can be confusing for both our designers and copywriters to edit.
Internal is great because it similiar to external css in that all css code is located in one place.
yet, it still exist in one HTML file. Therefore, its faster than external css However because its in the same file in our HTML code. 
our designer and copywriter will have to edit the same file when making changes
this can cause confusion and bugs
the best practice therefore is actually external css because it creats separations of concern.
which minimized team members from editing the same file at the same time.
