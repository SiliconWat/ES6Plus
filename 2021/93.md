Just like there are three ways to include css code in our HTML document
there are also three ways to include JavaScript code which we will cover in this problem set.
Similar to CSS the first method is also called external. When we write our Javascript code in this windown on codepen
we are really writing our js code into a separate file 
to demonstrate this let's create another codepen file.
now let's move our js code over to this new file
select all, then cut. 
If we save and refresh the console will not print "hello world" anymore.
Then in our external file, 
we paste. 
Then click save. 
To import this external file 
first we copy its link
then we go to our setting in our previous codepen
Under js, scroll down to add external script or pen 
then paste in the link
press save and closed
now notice hello world is back in the console. what happened? what did codpen do under the hood to make this possible?
the answer is by using a special tag called a script tag basically 
to import any exteranl file,
all we have to do is create a script tag in the head.
We must include a closing script tag because we can have content.
What kind of content 
we will discuss this in the next lecture
to imort our external js file we give our script tage just one attribute like this src equal quote past in our link 
src stands for source which behaves much like the href for the link attribute.
