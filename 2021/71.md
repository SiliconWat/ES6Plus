The UI widow is awesome because it show us from the code.
the console window is awesome tool because it allow us to print message to a location that only coders can see.
This is especially helpful when we write our javaScript code.
Therefore, in this lecture set, we will explore the console in more details. 
To review, when we tell javaScript to select the p element using this code, 
we can tell if it real works.
One way you can tell is to simply copy this code into the console and press enter.
this is what we have learn to do in the last leture set. another even better way is to use console.log()
then inside the parenthsis we can specify what we wanted to print into the console. In this case we can print in the same code.
There it is again.
Remember it can be anything. For example let say te number three without the command console.log() we can not see it in the console just likethe previous code. 
Now, lets add the console.log(3). 
there it is.
How about the word "hello world".
again, without the command console.log() it will not be printed  TO  the console. if we added console.log() "hello world" 
There it is.
Hope you realized by now that letters and words need to be inside quotes. more will be said about this in the future lecture. 
For now please just commit this to memory.
